# Tech Talk

## Description

This app utilizes many different files, database storage, and technologies to create a Tech Talk blog. A user can view any blogs on the main page and click them to see the comments. Both the post and comments will show who posted them.

If a user would like to create their own blog about the technology news of the day they can sign up to create an account or login to an existing one. Once logged in they now have access to a dashboard for posting blogs. They can also go to other blogs and comment on them leaving their name and a date.

The user then can logout and end their session or a timeout exists on the session as well.
